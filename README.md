# Git & GitHub Basics  

Welcome to the **Git & GitHub Basics** guide! This repository provides essential information to help you understand and use Git and GitHub effectively for version control and collaboration.

## What is Git?  
Git is a **distributed version control system** that tracks changes to files in a project. It allows developers to collaborate on code, maintain history, and manage different versions of a project.  

### Key Git Commands:  
- `git init` - Initialize a new Git repository.  
- `git clone <repository_url>` - Clone an existing repository.  
- `git add <file>` - Stage changes for a commit.  
- `git commit -m "message"` - Save staged changes with a message.  
- `git push` - Upload local changes to a remote repository.  
- `git pull` - Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.  
- `git status` - Check the current state of the working directory.

## What is GitHub?  
GitHub is a **web-based platform** for hosting Git repositories. It provides tools for version control, collaboration, and project management.  

### Features of GitHub:  
- **Repositories**: Store and manage your codebase.  
- **Branches**: Work on different features or bug fixes in parallel.  
- **Pull Requests**: Propose changes and collaborate with team members.  
- **Issues**: Track bugs, tasks, and feature requests.  
- **Actions**: Automate workflows with CI/CD pipelines.
